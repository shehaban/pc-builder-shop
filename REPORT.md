# PC Builder Shop Report

## Introduction

The PC Builder Shop is an online platform designed for customers to purchase high-quality computer components and peripherals. It caters to both individual users looking to build their own custom PCs and those seeking individual parts for upgrades or replacements. The website provides a user-friendly interface to browse, select, and purchase PC components from reputable brands.

2. **Using the PC Builder Tool**: For those interested in building a complete system, the site offers a dedicated PC Builder feature. This tool allows users to select compatible components step-by-step, ensuring that all chosen parts work together seamlessly. The builder automatically checks for compatibility, helping prevent common issues like mismatched sockets or incompatible power requirements.
